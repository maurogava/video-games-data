# Video Game Exercise

I din't use any UI framework like Bootstrap or MUI so you can evaluate my knowledge without having those components as base, which makes some things simpler. Nevertheless this is just a challenge with room for improvements and I think those improvements are out of the scope of this assignment.

### **Note**:

The `release_year` field is not available in the provided endpoint, so I didn't include it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn analize`

Analizes the packages to improve bundle sizes. It uses `source-map-explorer` package. You can chek the documentation [here](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer#readme).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
